// an intersect method will be needed here. Spheres in this assignment aren't actual
// rendered objects they simply return "true" when there is a collision. All
// we need to do is check against the sphere function
// The values provided in the assignment PDF should become member variables of Shape
// except for radius, which will go in Sphere.h.
